# Machine Learning and Data Science Definitions for Business (without copyright)

The purpose of these defintions are to lean towards ease of understanding and analogy as a means to quickly communicate work to management. Use it freely and don't feel the need to cite anyone. 

----

**Target** is what you want to predict.

*They have decided to use the next month's revenue as the target and not the number of customers serviced*

---

**Features** is the columns of data you are using to predict the target. 

*I have a list of features I am considering like the size of the house, the number of bedrooms and the number of bathrooms, to predict the value of the house (target)*

---

**Supervised learning** is a method to identify the relationship between data (features) and something that you are trying to predict (the target) using a machine learning model.

*He used a supervised learning model to predict whether or not the passanger will survive (the target) the crash by looking at their characteristics like their age and gender (the data)*

---

**Unspervised learning** is a method where you only want to identify the structure in data instead of predicting something. 

*He used a supervised learning model to predict whether or not the passanger will survive (the target) the crash by looking at their characteristics like their age and gender (the data)*
